# React to list and filter recipes

In this challenge, the idea was to list and filter recipes in the UI.

## Topics

This challenge covers

- React
- ES6
- Javascript
- Unit tests

## Requirements

- NodeJS

## ToDos

1. Render dynamically the `RecipeItems` component with the sample data.
2. When typing text in the input inside the `Navbar` component, the `RecipeItems` needs to be filtered by `title` or `ingredients`.
3. The filter needs to be `case insensitive`, meaning it doesn't matter if you type `Potato` or `potato`. It is the same text.

## Running the application

To install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

To run the application:

```
npm start
```
